# COEN 12 Projects
## About COEN 12
This repository includes all the projects I coded for COEN 12 at Santa Clara University.  COEN 12 is about Abstract Data Types and Data Structures, and the projects include different ways to store data, count the number of words and unique words in a file, and sort the words in the file

## Projects
- Project 1: This program reads and displays the number of words in a passed in text file. I programed `count.c`
- Project 2: This program uses a set abstract data type for strings, and I implemented a sorted and unsorted array to store the elements.  I programmed `sorted.c` and `unsorted.c`
- Project 3: This project uses a hash table to store data.  I programmed `strings/table.c` and `generic/table.c`
- Project 4: This project uses a circular, doubly linked list to store string. I programed `list.c` and `set.c`
- Project 5: This project uses insertion sort, quicksort, and mergesort to sort the number column in data.txt.  I programed `generate.c` to randomly generate integer and string pairs for data.txt, and `insertionSort.c`, `mergeSort.c`, and `quickSort.c` to read and sort the data
